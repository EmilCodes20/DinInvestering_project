An application that calculates the future value of an investment based on inputs. The application also contains a caculator of time for a loan to be paid back based on inputs.

The investment calculation in based on the FV formula, while the loan calculator is based of the annuity loan formula. This also assumes that the loan should be an annuity loan.

I am using Spring Boot (Java) as backend, while using the combination of HTML/CSS/JS as frontend.
